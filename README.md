10 customers buy every a thing for the price of 10 and give each 10% of this purchase in a pot then this pot with the purchase amount added come down to 10 and so the tenth customer would be so its contribution to the purchase and will fully able to recover the total price back. In this system everyone will reach once or more times the tenth place for this opportunity of money back why? Because to ad you to this system you need a bill for a thing you had purchased. With this bill the order of series sorted by date and time when ever client register the purchase bill in this web based system for the place from one up on to ten.
